This is only a temporary placeholder file.  Later, after you create the new Laminas MVC project, proceed as follows inside the Docker container:
<pre>
cd /srv/tempo/jumpstart
# Create the new project and call it "temp"
php laminas_project/composer.phar create-project -sdev laminas/laminas-mvc-skeleton temp
# Copy the contents into /srv/tempo/jumpstart/my_project
cp -r temp/* my_project/
</pre>	
</body>
